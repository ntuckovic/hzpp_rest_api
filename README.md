Rest API for hzpp.hr - passengers transfers

## Why?

As frequent Croatian Railways user for everyday communting from home to work and vice-versa, I wanted some quick, nicely formatted and easily accesible data source, for fun and educational purpose, to available trains, their departure times and seat reservations. Croatian Railways do not have any publicly open APIs for such purposes (such a shame if you consider time when we are living), so this little python app scrapes official webpage and its sources to return 2 sources for now: List of stations, list of trains available between to stations.
